          My development approach blends technical precision with a deep
          understanding of design and user experience. I build component-driven
          architectures, optimize performance with real-world constraints in
          mind, and care about details that make interfaces not just functional
          â€” but enjoyable.

          I&apos;ve sharpened my skills through hands-on training at the{" "}

            Information Technology Institute (ITI)

          , where I worked in agile-based team environments, followed best
          practices in code quality, and delivered projects aligned with real
          business needs. This experience enhanced my ability to collaborate,
          iterate fast, and deliver consistent value.

        <Paragraph>
          I&apos;m confident building complete UI layers from scratch,
          integrating with APIs, managing application state, and handling
          responsiveness, accessibility, and performance optimization. I write
          thoughtful code, communicate clearly, and continuously seek to improve
          both the product and the process behind it.
