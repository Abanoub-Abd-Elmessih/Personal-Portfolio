        I'm a front-end developer specialized in building responsive and
        accessible web interfaces. I work mainly with React and Next.js, and
        focus on clean code, performance, and great user experiences. I help
        businesses bring their designs to life by turning them into fast,
        functional, and maintainable front-end applications.
